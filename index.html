<p>
  I am currently a principle software engineer at Tencent, the leader of a team for developing Large Lauguague/Vision(LLM/LVM) Models training and inference software on heterogeneous hardware platforms, including GPU and NPUs.
</p>
<p>
  Over the span of a year and a half, I have had two startup experiences. I was one of the technical partner r at LightYearAI, serving as the first technical member upon the company's inception. I led a team of 20, overseeing Data Curation for the pre-training of large language models. The company was acquired by Meituan Inc just three months after its establishment.
  Prior to that, I was the CTO of a startup company dedicated to open-source AI infrastructures, where I led the project a href="https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI">ColossalAI</a>,, a training framework for large language models.
</p>
<p>
  Before that, I was a senior engineer at Wechat AI, Tencent. 
  My work was focused on improving the efficiency of online and offline AI applications with innovative parallel computing techniques.
  I also took part in the development of some basic modules in the WeChat App, including the WeChat Input Method Engine and the WeChat Translation System.
  I initialized and authored some open-sourced software, e.g. <a href="https://github.com/Tencent/TurboTransformers">TurboTransformers</a>, a fast runtime for transformer inference on CPU and GPU, <a href="https://github.com/Tencent/PatrickStar">PatrickStar</a>, a parallel training framework for large language models.
</p>
<p>
  I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Tsinghua University in 2019.
  My advisors are Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/csen/4623/2010/20101224195554390212530/20101224195554390212530_.html">Guangwen Yang</a> and Prof. <a href="http://47.94.243.94/mediawiki/index.php/Haohuan_Fu">Haohuan Fu</a>. 
  My research focused on applying High-Performance Computing (HPC) for scientific applications. 
  The title of <a href="https://fangjiarui.github.io/assets/pdf/fangjiarui_phd_thesis.pdf">my doctoral dissertation</a> is <i>Parallel Deep Learning Training System on Sunway TaihuLight</i>.
  I served as a visiting scholar under the supervision of <a href="http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~chohsieh/">Cho-Jui Hsieh</a> at the University of California, Davis, from 2018 to 2019.
</p>
<p>
  I enjoy sports. 
  My hobbies include jogging, football, swimming, and table tennis. 
  I am a billiards fan and won the bronze medal in the WXG Beijing League 2020. 
  I was an organizer of a table football league in my office building in 2020.
