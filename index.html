<p>
  I am currently a software engineer at ByteDance, leading the <a href="https://www.volcengine.com/product/ml-platform">Volcano Engine Machine Learning Platform (veMLP)</a> team. Before joining ByteDance, I was a principal software engineer at Tencent.
</p>
<p>
  My passion for open-source has led me to initiate and lead several widely-used projects, including:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/xdit-project/xDiT">xDiT</a> (⭐️<span id="xdit-stars">...</span>): A scalable inference engine for Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) on multi-GPUs.</li>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI">ColossalAI</a> (⭐️<span id="colossalai-stars">...</span>): A unified parallel training framework for large language models, which I led as CTO at HPCAI-Tech.</li>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/Tencent/PatrickStar">PatrickStar</a> (⭐️<span id="patrickstar-stars">...</span>): An efficient parallel training framework for large language models, now a core component of ColossalAI. It is used to train Tencent's <a href="https://hunyuan.tencent.com/">Hunyuan LLM</a> and is adopted by Alibaba Cloud's <a href="https://developer.aliyun.com/article/1610582">Pai-Megatron-Patch</a>. My contributions to this open-source project earned me Tencent's highest individual award in 2021.</li>
   <li><a href="https://github.com/Tencent/TurboTransformers">TurboTransformers</a> (⭐️<span id="turbo-stars">...</span>): A high-performance inference runtime for Transformers.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  From 2022 to 2023, I gained valuable experience in the startup world. I was a technical partner at LightYearAI, where I built and led a team of over 20 engineers focused on data curation for large language model pre-training. The company was acquired by Meituan just three months after its inception. Prior to that, I was the CTO of HPCAI-Tech for a whole year, a startup dedicated to open-source AI infrastructure at that time.
</p>
<p>
  Earlier in my career, I was a senior engineer at WeChat AI (Tencent), where I focused on improving the efficiency of AI applications through parallel computing. I also contributed to the development of foundational modules in the WeChat app, such as the <a href="https://z.weixin.qq.com/">WeChat Input Method Engine</a>.
</p>
<p>
  I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from Tsinghua University in 2019, advised by Prof. <a href="https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1107/3507.htm">Guangwen Yang</a> and Prof. <a href="http://47.94.243.94/mediawiki/index.php/Haohuan_Fu">Haohuan Fu</a>. My doctoral research was titled <i>Parallel Deep Learning Training System on Sunway TaihuLight</i>. I was also a visiting scholar at the University of California, Davis, supervised by <a href="https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~chohsieh/">Cho-Jui Hsieh</a> from 2018 to 2019. I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2014.

  Outside of work, I enjoy jogging, football, swimming, and table tennis. You can follow my work and interests on <a href="https://www.zhihu.com/people/feifeibear">知乎</a> and <a href="https://github.com/feifeibear">Github</a>.
