  I received a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Tsinghua University at 2019.
  During my Ph.D., my research focused on High-Performance Computing. 
  Two wonderful experiences outside campus enriched my Ph.D. study.
  I worked as a research scientist at the National Supercomputing Center in Wuxi from 2016 to 2019.
  I served as a visiting scholar under supervised of <a href="http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/~chohsieh/">Cho-Jui Hsieh</a> at the University of California, Davis, from 2018 to 2019.
